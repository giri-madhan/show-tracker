## Notes about working on this project:
1. Always pull down the main branch (called 'main') prior to creating a new branch from which to work
2. Create branches with meaningful names, such as task-211 or t-211, as a branch name
3. If you branched from the main branch multiple days prior to completing your task, make sure to switch to main, git pull, and then switch to your branch and git merge to keep the branch updated with main. This will help avoid merge conflicts.
4. If you push up your branch and there is a merge conflict, I will ask you to resolve that conflict as it cannot be merged otherwise.
5. Make sure to npm install and git pull before working on a task.
